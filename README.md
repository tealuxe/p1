## Outside resources
*I used the [Skeleton CSS framework](http://getskeleton.com/), a lightweight alternative to Bootstrap. I began with the default template and adjusted the margins and background color in an external CSS document. The image for the profile came from [GIFER](https://gifer.com/en/Mx3y). Bob Dobbs is the figurehead of a "parody" religion called the Church of the Subgenius. The quotations came from a [Wikiquote page](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/J._R._%22Bob%22_Dobbs). The "About Me" description is loosely derived from the narrative of the Church of the Subgenius books. For the random number generator, I consulted the [PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/function.rand.php) to understand the rand() function. I also consulted the [PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/function.count.php) to find the function to count the array length so that the random generation would not be hard-coded.*
